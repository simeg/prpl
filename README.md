# Purple
A minimal programming language (about to be) written in Python 3. Inspired by [kimi](https://github.com/vakila/kimi).

# TODO
- Read [1] and [2] and try to come up with the first step of writing this (what seems like) very complex thing.
- Outline the big steps needing to be done. Taken from kimi:
>Tokenize the program, parse the tokens into a tree, then evaluate the tree. Return the result, or an error message.
